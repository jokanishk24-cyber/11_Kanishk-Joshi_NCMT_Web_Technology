### 2. What is the purpose of the ”Launch” phase in web development?

## Group B: Long Questions (4 Marks)

### 5. ”Planning is the most critical phase of web development.” Discuss this statement by listing the key activities performed during the planning phase.
*Answer:*
Planning is the most important phase because it is the basis for the rest of the website. It is at this time that the developers and the client agree on the objective, target market, functionality, and content for the website. Such tasks as developing the site map, choosing the tech stack, cost estimation, and timelines are also accomplished at this point. Planning helps in minimizing mistakes in the development process.

### 6. Explain the iterative nature of the Maintenance phase. Why is a website never truly ”finished”?
*Answer:*
The maintenance phase is iterative because it involves continuous updates and improvements. Websites need regular content updates, bug fixes, security patches, and performance optimization. User needs and technologies keep changing, so a website must evolve over time. Therefore, a website is never truly “finished” and requires ongoing maintenance to remain useful and secure.

### 7. Describe the process of ”Information Gathering.” Why is understanding the target audience crucial during this step?
*Answer:*
Information gathering involves the process by which details are compiled with respect to the needs, goals, competitors, and content of the client. Knowledge of the target audience is very important, as it enables the designing of the website to adhere to the preferences, behavior, and expectations of the target users. This will ensure that the site is friendly, relevant, and efficient in its intended task.

## Group C: Scenario-Based Questions (5 Marks)

### 8. You are the project manager for a new e-commerce site. The client wants to skip the ”Testing” phase to save money and launch early. Write a persuasive argument explaining the potential risks (security, functionality, compatibility) of skipping this phase.
*Answer:*
I would strongly advise the client not to skip the testing phase if I were the project manager. Testing aids in locating security flaws that might reveal client information and online payment credentials. Important features like the checkout system or shopping cart might not function properly without testing, which could annoy customers and lower sales. Additionally, the website might not work properly on some browsers or mobile devices due to compatibility issues. Ignoring thi…
